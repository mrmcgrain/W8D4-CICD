Setting up Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow for Journaling Application

Assignment Overview:

You are tasked with setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for a journaling application called "CIJournal." The objective is to automate the process of building and testing the application using GitHub Actions. While deployment is not required for this assignment, you will focus on the CI aspect of the pipeline.

 

Requirements:

Repository Setup:
   - Create a new GitHub repository named "CIJournal" to host your journaling application.

   - Initialize the repository with a README.md file.

 

Application Development:
   - Develop a simple journaling application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

   - Implement basic functionalities such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting journal entries.

   - Keep the user interface minimal, focusing primarily on functionality.

 

Continuous Integration Workflow:
   - Set up a GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) to automate the CI process for CIJournal.

   - The workflow should trigger on every push to the `main` branch.

   - Include steps for checking out the repository, setting up the environment, installing dependencies, running tests, and reporting test results.

 

Testing:
   - Implement unit tests for critical components of the journaling application, such as journal entry creation, update, and deletion functionalities.

   - Ensure that the tests cover edge cases and handle thee potential errors and others, gracefully.

 

In the context of a journaling application like "CIJournal," several edge cases might occur that need to be considered when implementing unit tests and designing the application

 

Empty Input Fields: Test how the application handles scenarios where users submit empty fields when creating or updating journal entries. Ensure that appropriate validation messages are displayed and that the application does not crash or produce unexpected behavior.
 

Long Text Input: Test the application's behavior when users input long text entries, potentially exceeding the character limits or causing formatting issues. Verify that the application can handle and display long entries without performance degradation or display errors.
 

Special Characters: Check how the application handles special characters in journal entries, such as emojis, non-alphanumeric characters, or HTML tags. Ensure that the application properly sanitizes input to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS attacks and that it displays special characters correctly.
 

Date Format: Test scenarios where users input dates in various formats (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD). Verify that the application correctly parses and displays dates according to the specified format, and that it handles invalid date inputs gracefully.
 

Concurrency: Simulate scenarios where multiple users attempt to create, update, or delete journal entries simultaneously. Test how the application handles concurrency issues such as race conditions, data inconsistency, or conflicting updates. Implement locking mechanisms or optimistic/pessimistic concurrency control strategies to prevent data corruption.
 

Permissions and Authorization: Verify that the application enforces proper access controls and permissions, especially in multi-user environments. Test scenarios where unauthorized users attempt to access or modify journal entries, and ensure that the application restricts access and displays appropriate error messages.
 

Error Handling: Test how the application responds to unexpected errors or exceptions, such as database connection failures, server timeouts, or resource exhaustion. Verify that error messages are informative, user-friendly, and help users understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.
 

Browser Compatibility: Test the application's compatibility with different web browsers and versions, including popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Ensure that the application renders and functions correctly across various browser environments, without layout discrepancies or functionality gaps.
   - Configure the CI workflow to execute these tests automatically.

 

Documentation:
   - Provide detailed documentation within the repository on how to set up and run the CI workflow locally.

   - Include any challenges encountered during the assignment and how they were resolved.

 

Submission Guidelines:

 

- Submit the link to your GitHub repository containing the CIJournal project and CI workflow.

- Ensure that your repository is well-organized and includes a clear README.md file with instructions and documentation.

- Test your CI workflow thoroughly to ensure it runs successfully and reports accurate test results.

- Make sure to submit your assignment before the due date to avoid late penalties.
